                that our endurance will turn out to be difficult or end without them. As they serve us, they likewise need our adoration and serviceWe should love every creation of God, regardless of whether a plant or a creature. We should treat them
                with affection, and attempt to secure them, however much as it is possible to do. Likewise, cherishing nature incorporates keeping the air and water clean, planting numerous trees, taking care of the variety of animals, treating harmed
